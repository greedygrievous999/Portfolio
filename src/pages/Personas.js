            When starting new UI/UX projects, I often start by identifying different user personas for the interface I'm designing. In this project, I set out to research and identify different user personas for a vending machine on Brown University's campus.

            While in standby, the top dialogue screen reads

              A user may enter the corresponding number/letter code for their product of choice. 
              The top dialogue will display the price, but will not yet enter "purchase mode."
            </Desc>
            <Desc>
              For the machine to enter the flow of a purchase, the user must first swipe their card with the card reader to place a 
              hold on their account, then enter their product's corresponding code.

          For this project, I wanted to see how users feel about this specific flow, and if they found it productive or repetitive. Read about my process below.

          I began my process by observing how everyday users interacted with the vending machine. When I noticed a user struggled with the machine, I would follow up with a brief questionnaire (listed in the next section). In total, I counted:
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          - 8 observed users
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          - 4 interviews
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          - 1 failed attempted use

          Here are some highlights from my observations:
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          1. When you approach a vending machine, which part does your eye gravitate towards?
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          Users found they first gravitated to the window display before looking to the card reader just below eye level.
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          2. Can you trace a line of how you navigate across the machine?
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          The observed group generally moved left to right, then down. 50% of interviewed users said the path felt tedious or "loopy," and another 50% were frustrated by the presence of two screens (the product display screen and the attached card reader) with conflicting dialogues.
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          3. When does this flow get interrupted?
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          Users who followed the path listed above felt that having to enter the product number twice took them out of the flow of the interface. However, one stated that this repetition might be beneficial, as it requires a confirmation of the intended purchase.

          I wanted to form a deeper understanding of our users' goals, needs, experiences, and behaviors. So, I created two personas to represent some different approaches the vending machine's interface. I wanted to ask myself:

          What kinds of backgrounds and expectations do people approach the machines with?

          <Desc>
          How do these backgrounds affect their flow through the interface?
          </Desc>
          <Desc>
          What kinds of experiences do different personas walk away from the machine with?

            This project offered a great opportunity to research user interaction with a highly tactile and tangible interface, with lessons that will translate well to the design of digital interfaces. 
            </Desc>
            <Desc>
            By watching and interviewing users, I learned a bit about how users interpret and articulate their experiences with interfaces, and also how to compartmentalize different aspects of those experiences into specific traits/charactertistics.
            </Desc>
            <Desc>
            This project proved essential in my development as a UX designer, and continues to inform how I conceptualize and plan for different types of users of my interfaces.
