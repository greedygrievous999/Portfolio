        I set out to redesign redesign the website for Clone, a Rotterdam-based record store, to better match their web design with the feel of their products.

          Clone is one of my favorite record stores for dance music. The shop stocks lots of exciting techno and trance records, but their website has always made browsing their catalog quite difficult for me. The two-column design is quite dense, and the organization of browsing categories isn’t the most intuitive.

On top of the organizational issues, I found that the dated stylizations of the site fail to capture their forward-thinking music catalog and sensibility. 

Here you can see the site’s homepage. Below, I’ll list out the primary issues with the site.
